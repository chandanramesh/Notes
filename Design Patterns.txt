Design Patterns

Factory Design Pattern;
	It's always a best Practice to program to interface, rather then the actual implementation. If later Some things have to be added/remove then it will be 
	difficult to modify.
Sub 1 . The Simply Factory
		Not a actual Design Pattern, its a programming Idiom.
		Public class SimplePizzaFactory{
			public pizza CreatePizza(String type){
				if(type.equals("Cheese")
				pizza = new CheesePizza();
				if(type.equals("clam");
				pizza = new ClamPizza();
				return pizza;
			}
		}
	
	
	
	
Command Design Pattern:
	It decouples the requester of actions from the object that actually performs the actions.
	This is done by using the Command Object. The remote has the Command Object that knows how to talk to the right Object to get the Work Done.

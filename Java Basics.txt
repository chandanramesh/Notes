Exceptions:
	Imp: Be carefull with the finally block.
		 The Exceptions thrown inside the finally block , will hide the actual exception and the exception in the finally block will be propogated to the caller
		 methods.
		 
		 From JLS
		 If the catch block completes abruptly for reason R, then the finally block is executed. Then there is a choice:

		If the finally block completes normally, then the try statement completes abruptly for reason R.
		If the finally block completes abruptly for reason S, then the try statement completes abruptly for reason S (and reason R is discarded).

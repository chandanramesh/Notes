Java Key Points:


Topic Constructors :
		If the Constructors is Private, you cant extend the Class.
		
		
Topic Class 
		Obtaing lock on the Class Object.
		Class Object are Constructed During the Class Loading Time. It is Stored in the Perm Gen Space in Heap.
		Class Object Contain Some MetaDate About the Class functions,Packages, Fields , Constructors.
		Each Object belongs to a Class, and has it's respective Class Object.
		
		Class Object can be Obtained by two methods.
	1. Using Class Literal
		Class c = MyClass.class;
	2. Using getClass() Method.
		Class c = my.getClass();
		
	->.getClass() will return the class object at the Runtime. The .Class will return the Refernce type Class Object.
	->Primitive Type has Also Class Object
		Eg: int.class , float.class.
		
	->Class Objects are Stored in the PermGen Space of the Heap. They are Usually not Garbage Collected. GC happens when the ClassLoader goes out of Scope.
		
Topic MemoryManagement
		The Memory in case of Java is divied into 3 Spaces.
		1.Heap Memory.
		2.Method Area.-- It is part of non-heap memory. It Stores RunTime Constants and Static Fields. Code for Methods and Constructors.
		3.Java Stack.-- They are Private to the thread, in which it was created.
		
		Partition of the HeapSpace.
		1. Youg Generation - a.Eden Space - Intially Objects will be Put into here.
							 b.Survivor Space - When GC happens in the Eden Space the objects are Pushed into Survivor Space.
		2.Tenured Generation - Long Term Objects live in this Vicinity.
		3. PermGen - This is the Space where Class Objects are kept.(Usually Long- Term Objects are Kept here).

Android FrameWork

Other approaches of FrameWork
1. Patterns -- Both address the Same Issue of Reusing. FrameWork Address to the Concrete Design, algorithms. Patterns are restricted to the abstract design 
				FrameWork is a concrete Unification of the design patterns that are targeted for the particular application-domain.
2. Class Libraries -- Libraries are typical passive , ie they borrow the thread , and then processing happens.
					  In case of frameworks, they are Active, they own the even loop, when something is needed then hook methods are called.

					  
Android Services and IPC
Services:
		Have to extend the Service class.
		It runs in the Same Application thread. But Does'nt block the UI Behaviour.
		
Android Framework
		Key Points - 1. Inversion of Control.
				     2. Extensible Design and Code.
					 3. Domain Specific Functionality and Structure/
					 4. ReUsable Semi Complete Application.
					 5. Implementation Pattern Languages
					 
					 
	Inversion of Control - Hollywood Principle
						   "Dont call us we will call u".
						   It is used to build the Framework or components so that the lower level components can hook into it.
	IC basically advocates programming to interface rather then to implementations.

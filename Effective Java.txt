Item 2: Consider a Builder when faced with many parameters with constructors.
		Adv:1. The Builder Can take many Varrargs , since each method will set the parameter in different methods.
		Builder Pattern is a good choice when the no of variables are more.
Item 3: Singelton Class
		Use readResolve method to resolve the singelton class. This method will replace the object returned bby the deserializing , with it's own object.
		Enum Singelton: This is the best preffered approach for implementing the Singelton Class.
Item 4: Enforce Non instatntiability with the private Constructor.
Item 5: Avoid Creating Un necessary Objects.
		Prefer primitives over Boxed primitives , and watch out for unintentional autoboxing.
		Maintaing the Object Pool is much better choice, but in case of heavy weight Objects, it's better to maintain the Object pool instead.
Item 6: Eliminate Obsolete object references.
		Null the Obsolete references.
		Another example of memory leaks is by listeners and other callbacks.
Item 7: Avoid Finalizers.
